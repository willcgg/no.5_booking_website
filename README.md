# no.5_booking_website
## Purpose
Direct booking website for a short term rental property.
## Design

### Key Users

This application will mainly be used by guests staying in my short term rental property to book future stays or extend current stays. The users will need to be able to easily check availibility and book dates they require. For new guests that haven't stayed in the property before they will need to be able to clearly see pictures of where they would be staying along with any extra information needed once they have booked the space. Such as lockbox codes, parking information, electricity meter e.t.c.

For inspiration on this project I will be looking at the competition such as Airbnb to see what they have done well for their users.

### User Stories

New users will need to be able to view the property and its amenities, features, location and availibility to see whether they would like to stay there.

Current guests will need to be able to easily extend their stay should availibility allow for it.

Past guests will need to be able to easily view availibility for future stays and book for their chosen dates.

Property will NEVER be double booked e.g. booked on airbnb & direct booking site simultaneously.

Guests should be able to leave a review for potential future guests to read.
